# Atom Electric Imp Tools

`atom-imp-tools` is a package for the [Atom IDE](https://atom.io/) to enable seamless integration between Atom and [Electric Imp's](https://electricimp.com/) Cloud Services.  These tools use the [Electric Imp Build API](https://electricimp.com/docs/buildapi/).

This project was inspired by (and is in fact a shameless fork of) [Spark Dev](https://github.com/spark/spark-dev) - a professional, open source, hackable IDE, designed for use with Particle devices.

# Project Status
The project is currently in its infancy and is therefore highly unstable.  Very few spark features have been migrated to become Electric Imp features...
